# :dna: PromKappa 3.0 Objective Digital Stains in VB6
<kbd>PromKappa 3.0</kbd> is a complete application made in <kbd>Visual Basic 6.0 (VB6)</kbd> that generates <kbd>Objective Digital Stains</kbd> (aka DNA patterns). The main output of the application consists of a series of images that are saved in the <kbd>chart</kbd> folder (or <kbd>chart_comp</kbd> folder), which can be later analyzed using different methods. A second output can be the <kbd>results.htm</kbd> file which contains a series of measurements for each ODS generated by the application. Note that if you are familiar with python, then VB6 will come natural to you. Also note that once the application is started, the first step will be to load a FASTA file (the <kbd>gene_promoters_complete.fa</kbd>) using the <kbd>Open promoter file</kbd> button. In the PromKappa case the <kbd>gene_promoters_complete.fa</kbd> contains a series of gene promoters, as the analysis of gene promoters was the main aim of this application.
